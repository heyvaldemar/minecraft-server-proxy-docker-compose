# Minecraft Server Proxy Using Docker Compose

# The complete installation guide is available on my website https://www.heyvaldemar.com/install-minecraft-server-proxy-using-docker-compose/
# For details on deploying the Minecraft Server (not the proxy), check out this link: https://github.com/heyvaldemar/minecraft-server-docker-compose/

# Change variables in the `.env` to meet your requirements.
# ðŸ’¡ Note that the `.env`, `velocity.toml` file, and `plugins` folder should be in the same directory as `minecraft-server-docker-compose.yml`.

# Ensure that you are connected to the same Docker network as your previously deployed Minecraft servers. This is crucial for network communication between your server components.

# Configure the Path to `velocity.toml` in `minecraft-server-docker-compose.yml`:
#    - **Linux or macOS Users:**
#      - Ensure the following line is active in your Docker Compose file to correctly mount the volume:
#        ```yaml
#        - ./velocity.toml:/config
#        ```

#    - **Windows Users:**
#      - You need to adjust the volume mount path due to the different file path formatting in Windows.
#        Uncomment the line below and comment out the previous Linux/macOS line:
#        ```yaml
#        - ./velocity.toml:/config/velocity.toml
#        ```

#    This adjustment will set the correct path format based on your operating system, ensuring the server configures properly.

# ## Configuration Requirements for the Proxy Server
# To ensure the proxy server functions correctly, update both the IP addresses and ports in the `velocity.toml` file to reflect your specific Minecraft server setup.
# Itâ€™s crucial to replace the default `127.0.0.1` IP and example ports (25580, 25581) with the actual server IPs and the ports on which your Minecraft Server is running:
# ```toml
# [servers]
# # Configure your servers here.
# lobby = "127.0.0.1:25580"
# survival = "127.0.0.1:25581"

# # The order in which servers are tried when a player logs in or is kicked from a server.
# try = [
#     "lobby",
#     "survival"
# ]
# ```

# ## Initial Server Setup
# Upon the first startup of the Minecraft Proxy, a `forwarding.secret` file will be generated. Enter the contents of this file into the `config/paper-global.yml`
# on the Minecraft Server (not the proxy) within the `velocity` section to ensure a secure connection:
# ```yaml
# velocity:
#   enabled: true
#   online-mode: true
#   secret: REPLACE_WITH_CONTENT_FROM_THE_forwarding.secret_FILE
# ```

# ## Switching Between Servers
# Players can navigate between different Minecraft servers using simple console commands or through an interactive lobby interface provided
# by the Phoenix Lobby https://www.myphoenixstore.com/en/items/phoenix-lobby) plugin. For command-line switching, simply type `/server survival`
# to connect directly to the 'survival' server. Alternatively, for a more visually engaging experience, consider installing the Phoenix Lobby plugin on a separate server.
# This plugin enhances the lobby with customizable options like server selectors and NPCs, making server transitions smooth and visually appealing.
# This approach not only meets functional requirements but also offers a visually appealing and user-friendly environment for players.

# Deploy Minecraft Server using Docker Compose:
# `docker compose -f minecraft-server-proxy-docker-compose.yml -p minecraft-server-proxy up -d`
